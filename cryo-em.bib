  abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a mainstream technique for determining the structures of complex biological systems. However, accurate integrative structural modeling has been hampered by the challenges in objectively weighing cryo-EM data against other sources of information due to the presence of random and systematic errors, as well as correlations, in the data. To address these challenges, we introduce a Bayesian scoring function that efficiently and accurately ranks alternative structural models of a macromolecular system based on their consistency with a cryo-EM density map and other experimental and prior information. The accuracy of this approach is benchmarked using complexes of known structure and illustrated in three applications: the structural determination of the GroEL/GroES, RNA polymerase II, and exosome complexes. The approach is implemented in the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (http://integrativemodeling.org), thus enabling integrative structure determination by combining cryo-EM data with other sources of information.},

  abstract = {Researchers present a Bayesian inference method for heterogeneous systems that integrates prior information with noisy experimental data.           ,              Modeling a complex system is almost invariably a challenging task. The incorporation of experimental observations can be used to improve the quality of a model and thus to obtain better predictions about the behavior of the corresponding system. This approach, however, is affected by a variety of different errors, especially when a system simultaneously populates an ensemble of different states and experimental data are measured as averages over such states. To address this problem, we present a Bayesian inference method, called “metainference,” that is able to deal with errors in experimental measurements and with experimental measurements averaged over multiple states. To achieve this goal, metainference models a finite sample of the distribution of models using a replica approach, in the spirit of the replica-averaging modeling based on the maximum entropy principle. To illustrate the method, we present its application to a heterogeneous model system and to the determination of an ensemble of structures corresponding to the thermal fluctuations of a protein molecule. Metainference thus provides an approach to modeling complex systems with heterogeneous components and interconverting between different states by taking into account all possible sources of errors.},

  abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy is rapidly emerging as a powerful technique to determine the structures of complex macromolecular systems elusive to other techniques. Because many of these systems are highly dynamical, characterizing their movements is also a crucial step to unravel their biological functions. To achieve this goal, we report an integrative modeling approach to simultaneously determine structure and dynamics of macromolecular systems from cryo-electron microscopy density maps. By quantifying the level of noise in the data and dealing with their ensemble-averaged nature, this approach enables the integration of multiple sources of information to model ensembles of structures and infer their populations. We illustrate the method by characterizing structure and dynamics of the integral membrane receptor STRA6, thus providing insights into the mechanisms by which it interacts with retinol binding protein and translocates retinol across the membrane.},

  abstract = {We develop a method to extract structural information from electron microscopy (EM) images of dynamic and heterogeneous molecular assemblies. To overcome the challenge of disorder in the imaged structures, we analyze each image individually, avoiding information loss through clustering or averaging. The Bayesian inference of EM (BioEM) method uses a likelihood-based probabilistic measure to quantify the consistency between each EM image and given structural models. The likelihood function accounts for uncertainties in the molecular position and orientation, variations in the relative intensities and noise in the experimental images. The BioEM formalism is physically intuitive and mathematically simple. We show that for experimental GroEL images, BioEM correctly identifies structures according to the functional state. The top-ranked structure is the corresponding X-ray crystal structure, followed by an EM structure generated previously from a superset of the EM images used here. To analyze EM images of highly flexible molecules, we propose an ensemble refinement procedure, and validate it with synthetic EM maps of the ESCRT-I–II supercomplex. Both the size of the ensemble and its structural members are identified correctly. BioEM offers an alternative to 3D-reconstruction methods, extracting accurate population distributions for highly flexible structures and their assemblies. We discuss limitations of the method, and possible applications beyond ensemble refinement, including the cross-validation and unbiased post-assessment of model structures, and the structural characterization of systems where traditional approaches fail. Overall, our results suggest that the BioEM framework can be used to analyze EM images of both ordered and disordered molecular systems.},

  abstract = {To obtain a structural model of a macromolecular assembly by single-particle EM, a large number of particle images need to be collected, aligned, clustered, averaged, and finally assembled via reconstruction into a 3D density map. This process is limited by the number and quality of the particle images, the accuracy of the initial model, and the compositional and conformational heterogeneity. Here, we describe a structure determination method that avoids the reconstruction procedure. The atomic structures of the individual complex components are assembled by optimizing a match against 2D EM class-average images, an excluded volume criterion, geometric complementarity, and optional restraints from proteomics and chemical cross-linking experiments. The optimization relies on a simulated annealing Monte Carlo search and a divide-and-conquer message-passing algorithm. Using simulated and experimentally determined EM class averages for 12 and 4 protein assemblies, respectively, we show that a few class averages can indeed result in accurate models for complexes of as many as five subunits. Thus, integrative structural biology can now benefit from the relative ease with which the EM class averages are determined.},

  abstract = {The method presented here refines molecular conformations directly against projections of single particles measured by electron microscopy. By optimizing the orientation of the projection at the same time as the conformation, the method is well-suited to two-dimensional class averages from cryoelectron microscopy. Such direct use of two-dimensional images circumvents the need for a three-dimensional density map, which may be difficult to reconstruct from projections due to structural heterogeneity or preferred orientations of the sample on the grid. Our refinement protocol exploits Natural Move Monte Carlo to model a macromolecule as a small number of segments connected by flexible loops, on multiple scales. After tests on artificial data from lysozyme, we applied the method to the               Methonococcus maripaludis chaperonin               . We successfully refined its conformation from a closed-state initial model to an open-state final model using just one class-averaged projection. We also used Natural Moves to iteratively refine against heterogeneous projection images of               Methonococcus maripaludis chaperonin               in a mix of open and closed states. Our results suggest a general method for electron microscopy refinement specially suited to macromolecules with significant conformational flexibility. The algorithm is available in the program Methodologies for Optimization and Sampling In Computational Studies.},
