## Section I: Features of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPRs)

The core phenomena of intrinsically disordered proteins are reviewed in this section. 

## Lack of rigid structure

The main feauture of IDPs are their lack of rigid 3D structure. This is what makes their study so challenging, yet their physics so rich as well.

## Subsection: Correlations

In this section, i describe the quantities that have correlation to intrinsic disorder.

## Spacial and Temporal Heterogenuity

IDPs are charactarized by extreme spacial and temporal heterogenuity.

## Net charge 

TODO Figure out why net charge corresponds to disorder

## Hydropathy + net charge

#TODO why does hydropathy play into net charge?

> `The known boundary separating compact proteins and extended IDPs (\<R\> = 2.785 \<H\> −1.151, where \<R\> and \<H\> correspond to the absolute mean charge and mean hydropathy, respectively [40]);`

-Uversky, “Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and Their ‘Mysterious’ (Meta)Physics.” 


## Subsection 2: Net charge and hydropathy (why it matters for disorder)

We will look at this paper Uversky VN, Gillespie JR, Fink AL. Why are “natively unfolded” proteins unstructured under physiologic conditions? `Proteins (2000) 41:415–27. doi: 10.1002/1097-0134(20001115)41:3\<415::AID-PROT130\>3.0.CO;2-7 `

## Hydropathy

has to do with hydrophobic parts of the protien

## Charge

uncomposated charge in the protein.


## Subsection 3:  MinE Bacteria trasport

We look at the section on how IDPS go through phase changes in bacteria transport

## Put image of protein in environment here!

Here we set up stuff by giving an image of the protein along with physical
descriptions of its energy.

## introduct rate change equations

Derive the transition rates from first principes. connect the physics to the
biology vocab words

## With the rate changes defined, now describe the rate changes in play here

this is a good place for a table of the different rate changes and states

## Describe the models used (Stochastic)

Here we describe the stochastic model

## Describe the model used (mean field)

Here we describe the mean field model!

## Phase one: floatin around waiting for someon to show up

The lil disordered protein waits around for someone to show up.

## Phase two: Someone shows up

The change in local environment causes a phase transistion


## End of the line, gets detatced

The end of the line is reached and the protein detatches and floats around agian, waiting for that to happen again!

## Section 2: Flat energy landscape of IDPs

We look at IDPs from the lense of being frustraited systems. We learn about frustraitd systems and intro`

## Frustraited systems


Let's define what it means for a system to be frustraited.

## Free energy landscape

Let's define the free energy landscape for IDPs


## Section III: IDPs as Configurations: Using NMR and Molecular Dynamics to Study IDPs


In this section we look at IDPs through the lens of statistical mechanics. Then we look at how nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurments are used in conjuction with molecular dynamics to study IDPs.
