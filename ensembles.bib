  abstract = {Biomolecular structure determination has long relied on heuristics based on physical insight; however, recent efforts to model conformational ensembles and to make sense of sparse, ambiguous, and noisy data have revealed the value of detailed, quantitative physical models in structure determination. We review these two key challenges, describe different approaches to physical modeling in structure determination, and illustrate several successes and emerging technologies enabled by physical modeling.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent a significant fraction of the human proteome. The classical structure function paradigm that has successfully underpinned our understanding of molecular biology breaks down when considering proteins that have no stable tertiary structure in their functional form. One convenient approach is to describe the protein in terms of an equilibrium of rapidly inter-converting conformers. Currently, tools to generate such ensemble descriptions are extremely rare, and poorly adapted to the prediction of experimental data.},
