  abstract = {Approximately one-third of the human proteome is made up of proteins that are entirely disordered or that contain extended disordered regions. Although these disordered proteins are closely linked with many major diseases, their binding mechanisms with small molecules remain poorly understood, and a major concern is whether their specificity can be sufficient for drug development. Here, by studying the interaction of a small molecule and a disordered peptide from the oncogene protein c-Myc, we describe a “specific-diffuse” binding mechanism that exhibits sequence specificity despite being of entropic nature. By combining NMR spectroscopy, biophysical measurements, statistical inference, and molecular simulations, we provide a quantitative measure of such sequence specificity and compare it to the case of the interaction of urea, which is diffuse but not specific. To investigate whether this type of binding can generally modify intermolecular interactions, we show that it leads to an inhibition of the aggregation of the peptide. These results suggest that the binding mechanism that we report may create novel opportunities to discover drugs that target disordered proteins in their monomeric states in a specific manner.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The realization that a protein can be fully functional even in the absence of a stable three‐dimensional structure has motivated a large number of studies describing the conformational behaviour of these proteins at atomic resolution. Here, we review recent advances in the determination of local structural propensities of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) from experimental NMR chemical shifts. A mapping of the local structure in IDPs is of paramount importance in order to understand the molecular details of complex formation, in particular, for IDPs that fold upon binding or undergo structural transitions to pathological forms of the same protein. We discuss experimental strategies for the spectral assignment of IDPs, chemical shift prediction algorithms and the generation of representative structural ensembles of IDPs on the basis of chemical shifts. Additionally, we highlight the inherent degeneracies associated with the determination of IDP sub‐state populations from NMR chemical shifts alone.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered regions are predicted to exist in a significant fraction of proteins encoded in eukaryotic genomes. The high levels of conformational plasticity of this class of proteins endows them with unique capacities to act in functional modes not achievable by folded proteins, but also places their molecular characterization beyond the reach of classical structural biology. New techniques are therefore required to understand the relationship between primary sequence and biological function in this class of proteins. Although dependences of some NMR parameters such as chemical shifts (CSs) or residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) on structural propensity are known, so that sampling regimes are often inferred from experimental observation, there is currently no framework that allows for a statistical mapping of the available Ramachandran space of each amino acid in terms of conformational propensity. In this study we develop such an approach, combining highly efficient conformational sampling with ensemble selection to map the backbone conformational sampling of IDPs on a residue specific level. By systematically analyzing the ability of NMR data to map the conformational landscape of disordered proteins, we identify combinations of RDCs and CSs that can be used to raise conformational degeneracies inherent to different data types, and apply these approaches to characterize the conformational behavior of two intrinsically disordered proteins, the K18 domain from Tau protein and NTAIL from measles virus nucleoprotein. In both cases, we identify the enhanced populations of turn and helical regions in key regions of the proteins, as well as contiguous strands that show clear and enhanced polyproline II sampling.},

  abstract = {Resonance assignment of NMR spectra of unstructured proteins is made difficult by severe overlap due to the lack of secondary structure. Fortunately, this drawback is partially counterbalanced by the narrow line-widths due to the internal flexibility. Alternate sampling schemes can be used to achieve better resolution in less experimental time. Deterministic schemes (such as radial sampling) suffer however from the presence of systematic artifacts. Random acquisition patterns can alleviate this problem by randomizing the artifacts. We show in this communication that quantitative well-resolved spectra can be obtained, provided that the data points are properly weighted before FT. These weights can be evaluated using the concept of Voronoi cells associated with the data points. The introduced artifacts do not affect the direct surrounding of the peaks and thus do not alter the amplitude and frequency of the signals. This procedure is illustrated on 60-residue viral protein, which lacks any persistent secondary structure and thus exhibits major signal overlap.},
