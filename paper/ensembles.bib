  abstract = {Biomolecular structure determination has long relied on heuristics based on physical insight; however, recent efforts to model conformational ensembles and to make sense of sparse, ambiguous, and noisy data have revealed the value of detailed, quantitative physical models in structure determination. We review these two key challenges, describe different approaches to physical modeling in structure determination, and illustrate several successes and emerging technologies enabled by physical modeling.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent a significant fraction of the human proteome. The classical structure function paradigm that has successfully underpinned our understanding of molecular biology breaks down when considering proteins that have no stable tertiary structure in their functional form. One convenient approach is to describe the protein in terms of an equilibrium of rapidly inter-converting conformers. Currently, tools to generate such ensemble descriptions are extremely rare, and poorly adapted to the prediction of experimental data.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and multidomain proteins with flexible linkers show a high level of structural heterogeneity and are best described by ensembles consisting of multiple conformations with associated thermodynamic weights. Determining conformational ensembles usually involves the integration of biophysical experiments and computational models. In this review, we discuss current approaches to determine conformational ensembles of IDPs and multidomain proteins, including the choice of biophysical experiments, computational models used to sample protein conformations, models to calculate experimental observables from protein structure, and methods to refine ensembles against experimental data. We also provide examples of recent applications of integrative conformational ensemble determination to study IDPs and multidomain proteins and suggest future directions for research in the field.},

  abstract = {Integrative approaches using data from a wide variety of methods are yielding model structures of complex biological assemblies.           ,                             Biological assemblies and machines often elude structural characterization, hampering our understanding of how they function, how they evolved, and how they can be modulated. A number of macromolecular assemblies have been reconstructed over the years by piecemeal efforts, such as fitting high-resolution crystal structures of individual components into lower-resolution electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of the entire complex (                                1                              ). Although notable successes have been achieved in this way, ambiguous or conflicting models can still arise (                                2                              –                                4                              ). Thus, structural and computational biologists have been looking for new ways to put all of the pieces back together. Sophisticated integrative approaches are being developed (                                5                              ,                                6                              ) that combine information from different types of experiments, physical theories, and statistical analyses to compute structural models of multicomponent assemblies and complex biological systems.},
